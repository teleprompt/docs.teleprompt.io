Creating a project is quick and easy. Log in to the [teleprompt web dashboard](https://teleprompt.io/dashboard) using your GitHub account and agree to the terms and conditions.

Then click on the "create project" button or open the project list from the sidebar and click on the creation button there.

Give the project a name and submit. An API key for the new project will be created and shown to you. Use this key to [set up a teleprompt client](./client-setup).

Be aware that for security reasons this key is only ever shown once on creation. You can, however, create new API keys at any time.
